## Description 
   
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This application uses [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user.
